# ClaimConfig — Multi-Tenant Claims Configuration Platform

A multi-tenant platform for **configuring** how insurance claims are handled per tenant, and for **running** claims through a config-driven decision engine. Each tenant owns a versioned configuration spanning branding, claim types, approval routing, notifications, SLAs and custom fields. The same configuration that the admin UI edits is what the engine executes — there is no second source of truth.

## What it does

- **Onboard tenants** with a server-authoritative slug derived from the display name (diacritics, including Vietnamese, are stripped).
- **Configure each tenant** across six independent _dimensions_, validated as a whole before anything is saved.
- **Version every config change** — edits become drafts, drafts get published, and any previous version can be rolled back to.
- **Process claims** through a pure decision engine driven entirely by the active config: accept/reject, required documents, approval routing (auto-approve / tiered / committee), SLA deadlines, escalation and notification fan-out — each step explained in a human-readable trace.
- **Preview** a claim against any version or an unsaved draft without persisting anything.
- **Compare** any two configs (two versions of one tenant, or two different tenants) as a field-level changelog.

Three sample tenants — **SafeGuard**, **HealthFirst** and **GovHealth** — are seeded on startup so the app is useful immediately.

## Architecture

A clean, dependency-inverted layering: the domain has no outward dependencies; use cases orchestrate; HTTP and persistence are interchangeable adapters behind a port.

**The dimension plugin pattern.** Each configuration aspect is a self-contained package under `internal/dimensions/*` implementing one interface:

```go
type Dimension interface {
    Key() string
    Evaluate(cfg ConfigDocument, claim Claim, dec *ClaimDecision) // runtime logic
    Validate(cfg ConfigDocument) []FieldError                     // config-time rules
    DefaultConfig() any                                           // starter values
    UISchema() []FieldDescriptor                                  // widget metadata for the UI
}
```

Dimensions self-register via `init()` into `internal/registry`. The engine, the config validator and the JSON-Schema endpoint all iterate that registry, so adding a new dimension means adding one package — no central switch to edit.

**Claim processing pipeline** (`internal/engine`): ordering is explicit, not import-order-dependent.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["claimTypes gate"] -->|rejected| Z["return decision"]
    A -->|accepted| B["approval · sla · customFields · branding"]
    B --> C["notifications (last — reacts to approval outcome)"]
    C --> Z
```

`claimTypes` runs first as a gate (a disabled type short-circuits to rejection). Core dimensions then run independently. `notifications` runs last because it reads the approval outcome to decide which events fire.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Go** ≥ 1.25
- **Node.js** ≥ 20 (for the web app)
- **PostgreSQL** ≥ 14

### 1. Start PostgreSQL

Any Postgres instance works. For a throwaway local one:

```bash
docker run --name claims-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=claims -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
```

### 2. Run the API

The server runs migrations and seeds the three sample tenants automatically on startup.

```bash
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/claims?sslmode=disable'
export PORT=8080            # optional, defaults to 8080
go run ./cmd/server
```

### 3. Run the web app

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173 — proxies /api → http://localhost:8080
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>: **Tenants** (list / create / clone / configure), **Runtime** (process a claim), **Compare** (diff two configs).

---

## Demo walkthrough

A 5-minute click-through of the admin UI: **create a tenant → configure it → process claims → compare configs**. Make sure the API (`:8080`) and web app (`:5173`) are running, then open <http://localhost:5173>. The left sidebar has three sections: **Tenants**, **Runtime**, **Compare**.

### 1 · Create a tenant

1. Open **Tenants** (the default landing page) and click **Create Tenant** (top-right).
2. Clicking it opens the **Add New Tenant** page (`/tenants/new`) — a wizard with a stepper:
   - **Basics** — type a **Tenant name** (e.g. `Acme Health`). Under **Start from**, choose _Default configuration_ (or _Clone from: …_ to copy an existing tenant's config). Click **Next**. _(The URL slug, e.g. `acme-health`, is generated from the name by the server.)_
   - **Branding → Claim Types → Approval Rules → Notifications → SLA → Custom Fields** — each step is a form for that dimension. Adjust anything you like (e.g. on **Claim Types** toggle which types are enabled; on **Approval Rules** set the model and auto-approve threshold), or just click **Next** to accept the defaults.
   - **Review & Create** — check the summary (enabled claim types, approval model, SLA, custom-field count) and click **Create Tenant**.
3. On success you'll see **“Tenant Created Successfully!”** — click **Go to Tenant** to open its detail page.

> If the server rejects a field, the wizard jumps back to the step that owns it and highlights the error — fix it and continue.

### 2 · Configure it

You're now on the tenant page (`/t/acme-health`), with four tabs: **Config · Preview · Versions · Compare**.

1. The **Config** tab shows the active configuration as a read-only summary (display name, primary color, enabled claim types, approval model, notifications, SLA, custom-field count). Click **Edit configuration** to open the dedicated editor at `/tenants/acme-health/edit`.
2. The editor is a stepper over the six dimensions (**Branding → Claim Types → Approval Rules → Notifications → SLA → Custom Fields**), seeded from the active config. Change anything you like, for example:
   - **Approval → Auto-approve threshold** → `100000`
   - **Claim Types → DENTAL** → enable it and add required documents (e.g. `receipt`, `dental_chart`)
   - **Branding → Display name** → `Acme Health Plan`
3. The **Save & Publish** button sits **above the stepper** and stays disabled until your config differs from what's published. Click it to save a new config **version** and publish it as the active config in one step — there is no final review gate, so you can save from any step. Invalid values are highlighted on their owning step and block publishing.
4. Open the **Versions** tab to see the history: every version with its status, author and note, with the live one tagged **active**. Click a version to see a field-level **diff vs the previous version**; for any non-active version, **Rollback to this version** restores it (rollback creates a _new_ published version rather than deleting history).

### 3 · Process claims

1. Click **Runtime** in the sidebar (_Runtime — process a claim_).
2. In the **Claim input** card, pick your tenant from **Select a tenant…**.
3. Fill the claim form and click **Process claim**:
   - **Claim type** (e.g. `OUTPATIENT`), **Amount**, **Submitted at**, and optional **Custom fields (JSON)** (pre-filled with sample keys like `employeeId`, `policyNumber`).
4. The **Processing result** card shows the decision: accepted/rejected, required documents, approval outcome (**auto-approved** or **routed →** tier/committee), SLA deadline, notifications fired, custom-field validation, and a step-by-step **trace** explaining each dimension.
5. Each run is added to the **Processing log** table — click a row to re-inspect it. Try a few claims against your tenant to see the rules:
   - a **small** amount → **auto-approved** (≤ threshold),
   - a **large** amount → **routed** for approval,
   - a **disabled** claim type → **rejected**.

> The tenant's **Preview** tab does the same thing but lets you run a claim against a _specific version_ or an unsaved draft **without persisting** — handy for “what would v1 have decided?” before you publish.

### 4 · Compare configs

- **Across tenants:** click **Compare** in the sidebar, choose a **left tenant** and a **right tenant** (try `safeguard` vs `healthfirst`), then click **Diff**. The changelog lists every differing field as _added / removed / changed_ with its left and right values.
- **Across versions of one tenant:** open the tenant → **Compare** tab → pick two versions (e.g. `acme-health@1` vs `acme-health@2`) → **Diff** to see exactly what your edit in step 2 changed.

## Testing

**Backend**

```bash
go vet ./...
go test ./...          # unit tests run anywhere; configrepo integration tests use
                       # Testcontainers and require a running Docker daemon
```

The persistence layer is covered by a shared **contract test** (`configrepo/repotest`) run against both the in-memory and the Postgres (Testcontainers) implementations, so both adapters obey the same behavior.

**Frontend**

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npx playwright test    # smoke test (apps/web/tests/smoke.spec.ts)
```

---

## Conventions & design notes

- **Config is the single source of truth.** The struct definitions drive the JSON Schema (`invopop/jsonschema`), the UI form, the validator and the engine — they cannot drift apart.
- **Library-first.** Diffing uses `r3labs/diff`; schema generation uses `invopop/jsonschema`; migrations use `golang-migrate` (embedded via `embed.FS`). No hand-rolled equivalents.
- **Thin handlers.** All HTTP→status mapping lives in one place (`httpapi.fail`); domain errors (`ValidationError`, `ErrTenantNotFound`, `ErrSlugTaken`, …) map to `422/404/409`.
- **Slugs are server-authoritative** and Unicode-aware: `"Phòng khám Đa khoa"` → `"phong-kham-da-khoa"`. Collisions get `-2`, `-3`, … suffixes.
- **Security defaults:** proxy headers are untrusted by default, request bodies are capped at 1 MiB, and **secrets are never logged** (the `DATABASE_URL` is deliberately kept out of all log lines).
